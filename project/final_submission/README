This is the Code Submission of the NonStandardDeviation group.

The top level contains code used for the final submission, together with the
PredictMissingValues script. In addition, code that was used to create the
data and plots in the report is located in ./scripts/, while the actual data
resides in ./data/. Furthermore, ./code/ contains code that was used for
baselines mentioned in the report, but not relevant to produce the final
submission.
