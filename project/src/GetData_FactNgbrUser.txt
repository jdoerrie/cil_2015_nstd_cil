Starting parallel pool (parpool) using the 'local' profile ... [Warning: Found 1 pre-existing communicating job(s) created by pool that are
running. You can use 'delete(myCluster.Jobs)' to remove all jobs created with

{Error using parpool (line 111)
Failed to start a parallel pool. (For information in addition to the causing
error, validate the profile 'local' in the Cluster Profile Manager.)

Error in GetData_FactNgbrUser (line 33)
pool = parpool('local', 2);

Caused by:
    Error using parallel.internal.pool.InteractiveClient/start (line 326)
    Failed to start pool.
        Error using parallel.Job/submit (line 304)
        You requested a minimum of 2 workers, but the cluster "local" has the
        NumWorkers property set to allow a maximum of 1 workers. To run a
        communicating job on more workers than this (up to a maximum of 12 for
        the Local cluster), increase the value of the NumWorkers property for
        the cluster. The default value of NumWorkers for a Local cluster is the
        number of cores on the local machine.
