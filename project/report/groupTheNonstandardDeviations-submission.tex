\section{Models and Methods}
\label{sec:models_and_methods}
% Describe your idea and how it was implemented to solve the problem. Survey the
% related work, giving credit where credit is due.

% The models and methods section should describe what was done to answer the
% research question, describe how it was done, justify the experimental design,
% and explain how the results were analyzed.

% The model refers to the underlying mathematical model or structure which you
% use to describe your problem, or that your solution is based on.  The methods
% on the other hand, are the algorithms used to solve the problem.  In some
% cases, the suggested method directly solves the problem, without having it
% stated in terms of an underlying model. Generally though it is a better
% practice to have the model figured out and stated clearly, rather than
% presenting a method without specifying the model. In this case, the method can
% be more easily evaluated in the task of fitting the given data to the
% underlying model.

% The methods part of this section, is not a step-by-step, directive, protocol
% as you might see in your lab manual, but detailed enough such that an
% interested reader can reproduce your work.

% The methods section of a research paper provides the information by which a
% study's validity is judged.  Therefore, it requires a clear and precise
% description of how an experiment was done, and the rationale for why specific
% experimental procedures were chosen.  It is usually helpful to structure the
% methods section by:
% - Layout the model you used to describe the problem or the solution.
% - Describing the algorithms used in the study, briefly including details such
%   as hyperparameter values (e.g. thresholds), and preprocessing steps (e.g.
%   normalizing the data to have mean value of zero).
% - Explaining how the materials were prepared, for example the images used and
%   their resolution.
% - Describing the research protocol, for example which examples were used for
%   estimating the parameters (training) and which were used for computing
%   performance.
% - Explaining how measurements were made and what calculations were performed.
%   Do not reproduce the full source code in the paper, but explain the key
%   steps.

\subsection{Dataset}
\label{sub:dataset}

The dataset which was used throughout the development of our algorithm was made
available on the project course webpage~\cite{lab2015collaborative}. It contains
the ratings of \num{10000} users on \num{1000} movies on a scale between $1$ and
$5$. Naturally, not every user rated every movie, in fact only \num{1388107} of
the \num{10000000} possible ratings were present leading to a data sparsity of
$86\%$.

\subsection{Evaluation of Results}
\label{sub:evaluation_of_results}

In order to train and test the developed algorithm the present ratings were
randomly split in two disjoint sets of equal size. The first set then formed
the training set, i.e.\ data that was trained on, and the second set was used
for testing the algorithm. The chosen metric is ``Root Mean Squared Error''
(RMSE) which is defined in the following way~\cite{koren2008factorization,
  koren2010factor, koren2011advances}:

\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{\sum_{(u,i) \in \mathrm{TestSet}}
    \frac{{(r_{ui} - \hat{r}_{ui})}^2}{\abs{\mathrm{TestSet}}}}
\end{equation}

Here $r_{ui}$ denotes the real rating while $\hat{r}_{ui}$ is the approximation
through the algorithm. With ratings restricted to the interval $[1,5]$ valid
RMSE values range between $0$ and $4$, with lower scores being better. In
addition, the raw CPU time was evaluated for the project grade. This favors
solutions that are efficient with regard to time.

\subsection{Data Imputation and Baseline Estimators}
\label{sub:data_imputation_and_baseline_estimators}

Given that standard Collaborative Filtering algorithms such as K-Means and
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) require dense instead of sparse matrices
different strategies exist to fill in the missing values. The most simple one is
to replace all missing values with a constant zero value. Accuracy can be
improved by considering other constants such as the global mean $\mu$ of all
existing entries.  More advanced techniques try to approximate a given missing
value for a user $u$ and item $i$ by taking a combination the global mean and
the specific user and item means $b_u$ and $b_i$~\cite{koren2008factorization,
  koren2009matrix, koren2010factor, koren2011advances}:

\begin{equation}
  b_{ui} = \mu + b_u + b_i.
\end{equation}

$b_u$ and $b_i$ can be directly computed from the data, however it is advisable
to introduce regularize terms to overcome over-fitting when only very few
ratings are available. This leads to the following equations, where $R(u)$ and
$R(i)$ denote the sets of all ratings by user $u$ and item $i$
respectively~\cite{koren2008factorization, koren2009matrix, koren2010factor,
  koren2011advances}:

\begin{equation}
  b_i = \frac{\sum_{u \in R(i)} (r_{ui} - \mu)}{\lambda_i + \abs{R(i)}}\qquad
  b_u = \frac{\sum_{i \in R(u)} (r_{ui} - \mu - b_i)}{\lambda_u + \abs{R(u)}}
\end{equation}

$\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_u$ are regularize parameters that should be found via
cross-validation. Finally it is also possible to estimate $b_u$ and $b_i$ by
solving the regularized least squares problem~\cite{koren2008factorization,
  koren2009matrix, koren2010factor, koren2011advances}

\begin{equation}
  \min_{b_*} \sum_{(u,i) \in \mathcal K} {(r_{ui} - \mu - b_u - b_i)}^2 +
  \lambda \left( \sum_u b_u^2 + \sum_i b_i^2 \right ).
\end{equation}

Possible solution approaches include Alternating Least Squares (ALS) or
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The baseline estimators are able to capture a
lot of signal present in the data so that it is advisable to make this
preprocessing step part of every more involved algorithm. For example, the RMSE
score for a simple SVD solution improved drastically when missing data was
imputed with optimized baseline estimators.

\subsection{Factorized Models}
\label{sub:factorized_models}

Motivated by the progress a simple SVD approach could make we investigated more
sophisticated approaches.

\subsubsection{Regularized SVD}
\label{ssub:regularized_svd}

Shortly after the Netflix Challenge started in 2006 Simon Funk proposed the idea
of a ``regularized SVD''~\cite{funk2006netflix}. In contrast to an ordinary
Singular Value Decomposition this approach does not rely on the imputation of
missing values, but only considers actual present ratings for training. The
algorithm tries to find two matrices $P$ and $Q$ that accurately represent
user-item interactions. Both users and items get transformed to the same latent
factor space of a fixed dimension where their dot product is taken to measure
their compatibility. A rating $r_{ui}$ is then approximated by $\hat{r}_{ui} =
b_{ui} + q_i^{T}p_u$. In order to avoid over-fitting to the data a regularize
term is added that penalizes large magnitudes of $p_u$ and $q_i$. The
associated least squares problem is the following:

\begin{equation}
  \min_{q_*,p_*} \sum_{(u,i) \in \mathcal K} {(r_{ui} - b_{ui} + q_i^T p_u)}^2 +
  \lambda (\norm{q_i} + \norm{p_u})
\end{equation}

This problem again can be solved using either ALS or SGD\@. Here we assume that
the biases have been estimated in a preprocessing step, however it is also
possible to learn them at the same time as $P$ and $Q$.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
% Show evidence to support your claims made in the introduction.

% Organize the results section based on the sequence of table and figures you
% include. Prepare the tables and figures as soon as all the data are analyzed
% and arrange them in the sequence that best presents your findings in a logical
% way. A good strategy is to note, on a draft of each table or figure, the one
% or two key results you want to address in the text portion of the results.
% The information from the figures is summarized in Table.

% When reporting computational or measurement results, always report the mean
% (average value) along with a measure of variability (standard deviation(s) or
% standard error of the mean).
